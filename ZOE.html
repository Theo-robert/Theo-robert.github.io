	<h1>Hi and welcome to this site i believe you are
	going to be blessed by the contents of this site</h1><br>

	I want you to ask yourself the following questions<br>
	<ol>
		<li class="animated bounceIn">Do you know who you are?</li>
		<li class="animated fadeInDown delay-1s">Do you know where are you going?</li>
		<li class="animated fadeInRightBig delay-2s">Do you think you are valuable in this world?</li>
		<li class="animated slideInUp delay-3s">Do you know why are you here?</li><br>
	</ol>
	<p class="p1">Think about this thing is life only about being born growing up, getting a job, getting money, getting a cool wife and cool house and die? Or there is more?<br></p>
	<p>Okay if there is more how then can i know? Let me tell you something we have all heard of Jesus Christ. He came on earth and died for our sins so as to give us eternal life. Why would you think that God would bother himself to come down on earth just to die for you? It is because he loves you bro. He loves you sister. You are valuable to him not only to him but to this world also. He wants you to express his image on this world. Look at <strong>John 3:16</strong> "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life." The only thing that God wants you to do is to believe in Jesus Christ the one he sent to this world because he was tested in every single way but still he became victorious even death couldn't handle him. Take a look on <strong>Hebrews 4:15 </strong>
	You are his child. He didn't brought you to this world just to just live meaningless. He wants you to have life in abundance. He wants you to enjoy life to become a successful man to be a leader like he is through his son Jesus Christ.</p>

	<p>Only what God wants is for you to relate with him. To connect to him just accept Jesus as your Lord and saviour with this prayer Father i am sorry i believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins and that you raised him from the dead and he is alive today. Lord Jesus i believe that you are the only way to the Father come into my life and be the Lord of my life and i receive the Holy Spirit whom you promised to lead my life. Amen. </p>

	Congratulations through this prayer you are now the child of God. Let us walk together in this journey of salvation forever.
